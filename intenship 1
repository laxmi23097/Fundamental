Title of Project:
Movie Recommendation System

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, previous ratings, and interactions with the platform. This system can be implemented using various techniques like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or Hybrid methods.

Data Source:
For building a movie recommendation system, we commonly use datasets that contain information about movies, ratings, and user interactions. A popular data source is the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings of movies along with metadata about the movies themselves (like genres, titles, etc.).

Example dataset source:

MovieLens Dataset
Import Libraries:
Here are the libraries we will typically use in this project:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import surprise
Import Data:
Now, import the dataset into your project.

python
Copy code
# Load the MovieLens dataset (example using a CSV file)
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
Describe Data:
It's important to examine the structure of the data.

python
Copy code
# Checking the first few rows of the movies and ratings datasets
print(movies.head())
print(ratings.head())

# Checking the data types and missing values
print(movies.info())
print(ratings.info())

# Descriptive statistics for ratings data
print(ratings.describe())
Data Visualization:
You can visualize the data to understand patterns, distributions, or relationships between users and movies.

python
Copy code
# Visualize the distribution of ratings
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(ratings['rating'], bins=10, kde=False)
plt.title('Distribution of Movie Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Number of ratings per movie
ratings_count = ratings.groupby('movieId').size()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ratings_count.plot(kind='hist', bins=50, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Number of Ratings per Movie')
plt.xlabel('Number of Ratings')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
Data Preprocessing:
Prepare the data for model building. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical data, or normalizing values.

python
Copy code
# Merge movies and ratings dataset
data = pd.merge(ratings, movies, on='movieId')

# Drop rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Encode movie genres (if needed for content-based recommendation)
# You can split genres into separate columns or encode them with LabelEncoder, for example
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['genre_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['genres'])

# Normalize ratings if needed (usually for collaborative filtering)
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data['rating'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['rating']])
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):
For a recommendation system, typically, you would define the features and target variable as follows:

X (Features): UserId, MovieId, possibly Genre, Timestamp, etc.
y (Target): Rating (or could be a recommendation score).
python
Copy code
X = data[['userId', 'movieId']]  # Example feature set
y = data['rating']  # Target variable (ratings)
Train Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing datasets.

python
Copy code
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Modeling:
You can choose from different recommendation models depending on the technique. For simplicity, let's use Collaborative Filtering using KNN (k-nearest neighbors). Alternatively, you could use more complex algorithms such as matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD) or deep learning-based models.

Example using Collaborative Filtering with KNN:

python
Copy code
# Build the model using KNN
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Pivot the data to create a user-item matrix
user_movie_matrix = data.pivot(index='userId', columns='movieId', values='rating').fillna(0)

# Fit the model
knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5, algorithm='auto', metric='cosine')
knn.fit(user_movie_matrix.values)

# Find similar users for a given user
user_index = user_movie_matrix.index.get_loc(1)  # Example for userId=1
distances, indices = knn.kneighbors(user_movie_matrix.iloc[user_index, :].values.reshape(1, -1))

# Output the similar users
similar_users = user_movie_matrix.iloc[indices.flatten()]
For Content-Based Filtering, you'd use features like movie genres, descriptions, etc., and create a recommendation system based on content similarity (e.g., using cosine similarity).

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance based on prediction accuracy (e.g., RMSE, MAE) or based on precision and recall in the context of recommendations.

python
Copy code
# Calculate RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print("RMSE: ", rmse)
For a recommendation system, you can also evaluate how well the system ranks movies for the user. One common approach is to use Precision@K or Recall@K.

Prediction:
After training the model, you can use it to make predictions, such as recommending movies for a user.

python
Copy code
# Example: Predict ratings for a given user and movie
user_id = 1
movie_id = 50
predicted_rating = model.predict(user_id, movie_id)

# Predict top 5 movie recommendations for a user
user_ratings = user_movie_matrix.iloc[user_id, :]
similar_movies = knn.kneighbors(user_ratings.values.reshape(1, -1))
recommended_movie_ids = similar_movies[1].flatten()

# Show the recommended movies
recommended_movies = movies[movies['movieId'].isin(recommended_movie_ids)]
print(recommended_movies)
Explanation:
Collaborative Filtering looks at usersâ€™ past interactions (ratings) to recommend items that similar users have liked.
Content-Based Filtering uses the characteristics of the items themselves (such as movie genres) to recommend similar items.
Evaluation helps assess how well the recommendation system is performing in terms of making accurate predictions or rankings.
